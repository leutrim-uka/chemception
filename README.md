# Chemception [in progress]
This repository is a supplement of the paper on Chemception's applications in predicting cancer cells' response to
different drugs (compounds).

## Background & Idea
Recent machine learning research in the domain of oncology utilizes SMILES encoding to represent the molecular structure
of the drugs used to treat cancer. They improve upon baselines built with Morgan's fingerprints. In turn, this paper uses 
SMILES to build a baseline, while exploring the abilities of Chemception to further improve on the topic by using image 
representations of the molecular structures of compounds, instead of a textual representation via SMILES.

# Implementation
## SMILES embeddings
